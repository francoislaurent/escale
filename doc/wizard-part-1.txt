You may run into a license acceptance step that requires to answer two yes-no questions. 
You must accept the terms of the license if you want to use |escale|.

The configuration wizard offers an expert mode and a simplified mode.

The simplified mode is considered self-explanatory and most users may safely follow the steps of this mode.

This tutorial covers the expert mode. 

.. parsed-literal::

	Run in simplified mode: [Y/n] :strong:`n` |enter|

If you set |escale| up for the first time, you will first be requested the path of the folder you want to synchronize:

.. parsed-literal::

	Editing configuration file '$HOME/.config/escale/escale.conf'
	Path of your local repository (required): :strong:`~/Shared Files` |enter|

where ``~/Shared Files`` is the folder which content will be synchronized in this example.

If the directory you specify does not exist, |escale| will make it for you.
