If you want to encrypt the data before they are sent to the relay storage, you will
need to share a same encryption key between all the clients that synchronize over
the same relay repository.

The first client to be set up can generate a key. 
This key will be available in a file that can be copied into the other clients.

The first client would perform the following steps:

.. parsed-literal::

	Encryption: [on] |enter|
	Passphrase filename [my-first-repository.passphrase]: |enter|
	'$HOME/.config/escale/my-first-repository.passphrase' file does not exist yet
	Generate a new key? [Y/n] |enter|
		key: b'_0Uozrh6S6RJ0ybOlJvZWreGFl6NffMUbU8xGvZ5QJw='

while the others would get a copy of the generated file - here called ``x.passphrase`` - 
and perform the following steps:

.. parsed-literal::

        Encryption: [on] |enter|
        Passphrase filename [my-first-repository.passphrase]: |enter|

In the above example, the ``my-first-repository.passphrase`` file is expected to be in the current directory or the configuration directory. 
You can alternatively specify a filepath.

.. note:: A passphrase file is not a text file. 

	Especially, the passphrase stored in it should not be followed by a newline or carriage return character, 
	otherwise these trailing characters would be included in the passphrase. 

.. important:: Passphrases are private and should not be sent in plain emails. 
	Consider encrypted emails or services like `onetimesecret.com`_. 

	Pay special attention not to introduce newline or carriage return while editing a passphrase file.

You are then requested to specify in which mode synchronize should operate:

.. parsed-literal::

	Synchronization mode can be 'upload', 'download', 'shared' or 'conservative' 
	Request help with '?'
	Which mode for this client? [shared] |enter|

More information about synchronization modes can be found in `this page <usage.html#synchronization-modes>`_.

Especially, if you want to implement a simple backup setup, you may have two clients: 

* the one that accommodates the active data will be set in *upload* mode, 
* the other one that accommodates the backup copy will be set in *download* mode.


The last few steps are straightforward:

.. parsed-literal::

	Refresh interval (in seconds): [10] |enter|
	Request help with '?'
	Disk quota: [] :strong:`1` |enter|
	Do you want to add/edit another section? [N/y] |enter|

Setting disk quota to ``1`` will make |escale| use no more than one gigabyte in your Dropbox space.
